1. Install requirments in requirments.txt
2. Run either ackerman, diwheel or trailer
3. Resulting path will show up after


grid.py generates the world with obstacles and goals (it's reused from other assignments)
In ackerman_planner.py (i was to lazy to rename it) you will find a hybrid A* planner that has helper functions
based off of which vehicle is being planned, the diwheel is the simplest with succesors genereated by hard coded directions
Ackerman steering using its kinematics to generates its succesors and so does the trailer, but it also takes into account its trailer.
The cost heavily penalizes backwards moves because the planner always wanted the trailer to go backwards.
The configuration space is generated by passing a kernel over the map with a size of VEHICLE_SIZE, so then when it is checking for collisons a simple point check suffices
